# Sentiment_analysis
To classify movie reviews as positive or negative, leveraging natural language processing techniques for feature extraction and evaluation using naive bayes.
This project implements a sentiment analysis model using a Naive Bayes classifier to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. The model leverages the movie_reviews dataset from the nltk library and processes the data using CountVectorizer for feature extraction. The primary aim is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Naive Bayes algorithm in sentiment classification.
Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) task that determines the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed in text data. This project focuses on binary classification of movie reviews, aiming to predict whether a review conveys a positive or negative sentiment. The dataset used is a pre-labeled corpus of movie reviews from the nltk library. This dataset is processed and classified using a Naive Bayes classifier, known for its efficiency and effectiveness in text classification tasks.
Model Performance  Accuracy: The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 85%-90% (actual values depend on the runtime environment and random splits).  Classification Report: The report detailed the precision, recall, and F1-score for both positive and negative classes, indicating strong performance.
Conclusion: This project demonstrates the successful application of a Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment analysis. The model performs well on the movie_reviews dataset, achieving high accuracy and meaningful predictions. Future work can focus on enhancing the feature extraction and exploring advanced algorithms to handle more complex textual data.
